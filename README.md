# Customer Churn Prediction

The goal of this project is to analyze the customer credit card portfolio data to identify the underlying factors contributing to customer attrition, and subsequently develop a predictive model to forecast which customers are at risk of dropping off soon. This solution should empower the business to proactively implement retention strategies and reduce customer churn, ultimately safeguarding the portfolio's profitability and long-term sustainability.
